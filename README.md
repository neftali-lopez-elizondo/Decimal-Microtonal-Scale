# Decimal-Microtonal-Scale
Proposal for a solution to the "wolf interval" problem and the Pythagorean comma.

## Overview
This repository presents a proposal for a solution to the "wolf interval" problem and the Pythagorean comma through a decimal microtonal musical system. The approach explores alternative tuning structures and frequency divisions to improve harmonic consistency and reduce tuning discrepancies inherent in traditional systems.

## Contents
- `docs/` : Detailed theoretical explanations, diagrams, and references.
- `data/` : Experimental data, scales, and MIDI files.
- `scripts/` : Code to generate scales and perform simulations.

## Objectives
- Develop a mathematically consistent microtonal system.
- Resolve tuning issues caused by the Pythagorean comma.
- Provide tools and scripts for scale generation and auditory testing.
